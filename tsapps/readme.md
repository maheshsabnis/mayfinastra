# Programming with TypeScript
- ES 6 features (7,8,9,10,11, esnext)
    - Block Scope variable definition using 'let' 
    - TypeSystem
    - Union Types
    - Rest Parameters
    - Template String
    - Arrow Operators
    - Array and String Functions
    - Object Oriented Programming   
        - class, interface, generics
        - access specifiers
        - Inheritance
    - Modules
- ES 6 Languages
    - High-Level JavaScript aka Modern JavaScript aka ES 6/7/8/9/10/11/esnext
        - Used by React and Vue.js, Node.js optionally used by Angular (Not Recommended)
    - TypeScript
        - By Microsoft 
        - Used as a default language by Angular
        - Can be used for React, Vue.js, Node.js   
        - Best suitable for Code sharing across JS Libs and Frameworks
        - Explicit Features Only Available in TypeScript by default
            - Data Types, Union Types, private, protected access specifiers
    - Dart
        - By Google
- TypeScript is shipped as a Library for Programming
    - npm install -g typescript
        - Offers the 'tsc' tool
            - USed for Transpiling TypeScript Code (.ts file) into JavaScript Code (.js)
            - Transpilation
                -  tsc SOURCE-FILE.ts, this will result into SOURCE-FILE.js
        - The TypeScript Project Configuration (Very Important in Angular)
            - tsc -init
                - Generate 'tsconfig.json' file with the Current Project configuration      

- Iterations over the Collection
    - for..loop
    - for..in loop, simplification over the for..loop
    - for..of loop, new in ES 6, uses the Iterator  
    - forEach(callback-function)
        - Iteration w/o changing the original collection 
        - does not return anything 
    - map(callback-function)
        - Iteration, but can change the original collection based on condition and return the collection of same size
        - if condition does not match on collection element, then in return value it is 'undefined'  
    - filter(callback-function)
        - Iterate, and return a new collection with modified size based on condition matched on elements  
    - ES 7 method,  reduce(callback-function), wrapper on the forEach for specific implementation 
        - Process the collection itself for
            - summation of all values
            - creating Group inside the collection based on matching key
            - Finding out the frequency of repetition of data in the collection
